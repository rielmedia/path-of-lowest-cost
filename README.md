# Path of Lowest Cost
A practice script that selects the path with the lowest sum of values from each of its cells.
...

### Installation
Download the source code then upload the files to your server.

``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/rielmedia/path-of-lowest-cost.git 
```

### Usage
Select a .txt file using the file upload input field.  The .txt file will be used to create the grid so it should contain a series of delimited integers on a single line.  Each line should contain the same number of integers and the integers should not be in any particular order.

Upon selecting a file, the input field will disappear and a grid will be built using the input from the file.  If a cell in the grid is missing an integer then you may need to check your file to make sure that each line contains the same number of integers.

Next click the "Find Path" button to run the path algorithm and that's it!
